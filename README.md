## Front End

I first create a wire frame with html, and css. 
I find it very useful to get the styling and elements to an almost finished product before I start on any of the back end.
I had some issues getting the icons to show up correctly, but then realized I was using a outdated Fontawesome link tag

## Back End

Using Javascript I called on the open weather map api and open street map api to get all of my weather and location information.
Once I figure out what information I needed, it was pretty straight forward feeding it into my html elements.
Initially I wanted to create all of my html and css from javascript. But it seemed more daunting work than I thought.
And making html wireframe is quite relaxing.
